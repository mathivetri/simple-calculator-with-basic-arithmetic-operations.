# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user is prompted to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The application then performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


## Usage

Run the `calculator.py` script:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions:

1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the second number.
3. Choose an operation:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division

The application will perform the chosen operation and display the result.

## Example

```text
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result is: 15.0
```

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the need for a simple arithmetic calculator.

Feel free to customize the README and the script to fit your specific needs.
